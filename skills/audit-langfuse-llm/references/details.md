## Phase 5: Prompt Improvement Cycle (PDCA)

After the audit report identifies prompt weaknesses, run an iterative improvement cycle for each
flagged prompt. This is the **Do-Check-Act** loop that turns audit findings into measurable improvements.

> **Max 3 iterations per prompt.** If no improvement after 3 attempts, log as "needs manual prompt engineering" and move on.

> **Always capture baseline BEFORE making changes.** Without a baseline, you cannot measure improvement.

> **Never promote a prompt version that scores worse than baseline.** The goal is monotonic improvement.

### 5a. Capture Baseline

For each prompt flagged in Phase 2b (Prompt Quality Audit), record the current state:

```bash
npx langfuse-cli api prompts get --name "<PROMPT_NAME>"
```

Record:
- **Current version number** and **label** (e.g., v3, label: `production`)
- **Current eval scores** from Phase 2d (average score, score distribution)
- **Current cost metrics** from Phase 2c (model, avg tokens, avg latency, est. cost/call)
- **Specific weaknesses** identified in the audit (missing guardrails, no few-shot, vague instructions, etc.)

Build a baseline table:

| Prompt | Version | Avg Score | Avg Latency | Avg Cost | Weaknesses |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| ...    | ...     | ...       | ...         | ...      | ...        |

### 5b. DO: Improve the Prompt

For each flagged prompt, create an improved version based on the audit findings.

**Step 1: Research the specific improvement needed**

```json
CallMcpTool(server: "user-firecrawl", toolName: "firecrawl_search", arguments: {
  "query": "<WEAKNESS_TYPE> prompt engineering best practices [current year]",
  "limit": 5
})
```

Example queries by weakness type:
- Missing guardrails: `"LLM safety guardrails system prompt best practices [current year]"`
- No few-shot: `"few-shot prompting examples for <TASK_TYPE> [current year]"`
- Vague instructions: `"structured output prompt engineering chain-of-thought [current year]"`
- Wrong model: `"<TASK_TYPE> model selection GPT-4o-mini vs GPT-4o vs Claude [current year]"`

Scrape the top 1-2 results for concrete patterns:

```json
CallMcpTool(server: "user-firecrawl", toolName: "firecrawl_scrape", arguments: {
  "url": "<BEST_RESULT_URL>",
  "formats": ["markdown"],
  "onlyMainContent": true
})
```

**Step 2: Draft the improved prompt**

Apply the researched improvements. Common enhancement patterns:
- **Add role definition**: "You are a [specific role] with expertise in [domain]."
- **Add output format**: "Respond in JSON with the following schema: {...}"
- **Add guardrails**: "If the user asks about [off-topic], respond with [refusal]."
- **Add few-shot examples**: Include 2-3 input/output pairs for complex tasks
- **Add chain-of-thought**: "Think step by step before answering."
- **Constrain output length**: "Keep your response under [N] words/tokens."
- **Add grounding instructions**: "Only use information from the provided context. If unsure, say so."

**Step 3: Create the new version**

If prompts are managed in Langfuse:

```bash
npx langfuse-cli api prompts create --name "<PROMPT_NAME>" --prompt "<IMPROVED_PROMPT_TEXT>" --labels experiment
```

This creates a new version with the `experiment` label (not `production` — we test first).

If prompts are hardcoded in source code:
1. Read the file containing the prompt
2. Edit the prompt text using StrReplace
3. Record the file path and the change for potential rollback

### 5c. CHECK: Trigger and Verify via Playwright

**Important**: Apply the `browser-anti-stall` protocol for all browser interactions.

**Step 1: Trigger the AI feature**

```json
CallMcpTool(server: "user-playwright", toolName: "browser_navigate", arguments: {
  "url": "<APP_URL>"
})
```

Navigate to the feature that uses this prompt. Interact with it (fill form, click button, send message).

Capture:
- AI-generated response via `browser_snapshot`
- Console errors via `browser_console_messages`
- Network requests via `browser_network_requests`
- Screenshot via `browser_take_screenshot` (visual evidence for the report)

**Step 2: Repeat N=3 times minimum**

Trigger the feature at least 3 times with different inputs to get a representative sample.
Vary the inputs to test edge cases relevant to the improvement (e.g., if you added guardrails,
test with an off-topic input).

**Step 3: Verify traces landed in Langfuse**

Wait 5-10 seconds after each trigger, then:

```bash
npx langfuse-cli api traces list --limit 10
```

For each new trace, verify:
- [ ] Trace uses the new prompt version (check metadata or generation details)
- [ ] Input/output captured correctly
- [ ] Generation includes model, token usage, latency

### 5d. CHECK: Score Comparison

**Option A: If Langfuse datasets exist** (preferred — most rigorous)

Run the dataset experiment with the new prompt version vs the old:

```bash
npx langfuse-cli api datasets list
```

If a relevant dataset exists, use Langfuse's Experiment feature (via UI or SDK) to run both
prompt versions against the same dataset and compare scores side-by-side.

**Option B: If LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators are configured**

Check if automated eval scores have been generated for the new traces:

```bash
npx langfuse-cli api scores list --limit 20
```

Compare the scores attached to new traces (experiment version) vs old traces (production version).

**Option C: Live trace comparison (minimum viable)**

From the N=3+ triggers in Step 5c, compare the new traces against baseline:

| Metric | Baseline (avg) | New Version (avg) | Delta | Verdict |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------|---------|
| Eval score | ... | ... | +/-% | Better / Worse / Same |
| Latency | ...ms | ...ms | +/-% | Better / Worse / Same |
| Input tokens | ... | ... | +/-% | Better / Worse / Same |
| Output tokens | ... | ... | +/-% | Better / Worse / Same |
| Est. cost/call | $... | $... | +/-% | Better / Worse / Same |
| Grounding accuracy | ... | ... | +/-% | Better / Worse / Same |

### 5e. ACT: Promote or Rollback

Based on the score comparison:

**Score improved (any eval metric improved, no metric degraded):**
- If Langfuse-managed: promote the new version to `production` label
- If hardcoded: keep the source code change, commit it
- Log the improvement in the report

**Score unchanged (no significant difference):**
- Keep the new version as `staging` for further observation
- Document why the improvement didn't move the needle
- Try a different improvement strategy in the next iteration

**Score degraded (any eval metric worsened):**
- If Langfuse-managed: do NOT change labels — the `production` label stays on the old version
- If hardcoded: revert the source code change using StrReplace
- Document what went wrong and why

**Repeat the cycle** from Step 5b with a different strategy if the score target has not been met
and iterations remain (max 3).

### 5f. Iteration Log

Track all iterations in a structured log:

```
PDCA ITERATION LOG — [Prompt Name]

Baseline: v[N], score [X], latency [Y]ms, cost $[Z]/call

--- Iteration 1 ---
Strategy: [what was changed and why]
Changes: [specific edits to the prompt]
Result: score [X1], latency [Y1]ms, cost $[Z1]/call
Delta: score [+/-A%], latency [+/-B%], cost [+/-C%]
Verdict: [PROMOTE / CONTINUE / ROLLBACK]

--- Iteration 2 ---
Strategy: [different approach based on Iteration 1 results]
...

--- Iteration 3 (final) ---
...

FINAL OUTCOME: [Promoted vN+K to production / No improvement — needs manual engineering]
```
